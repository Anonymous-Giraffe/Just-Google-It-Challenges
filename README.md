# Just-Google-It-Challenges
Anonymous repo to host the challenge code for Just Google It!

Inside each folder you will find a copy of the source code for the problem as well as a readme containing compilation instructions, the description showed to participants on the CTF website, the progression of hints, and one potential solution path for the problem. Participants were explicitly provided the first four hints (Name of Vuln -> First steps to the solution) verbatum, progressively every 10 minutes. The last hint delivered at 50 minutes was tailored to whatever they were struggling with in that moment.
